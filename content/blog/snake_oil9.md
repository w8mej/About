As we bring this discussion series to a close, it's imperative to contextualize our journey through the evolving landscapes of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Information Security within the broader frameworks of their respective hype cycles.

### **Understanding the Hype Cycles**

The hype cycle serves as a graphical representation of the maturity, adoption, and social application phases of specific technologies. Both AI and Information Security have seen their hype cycles, characterized by peaks of inflated expectations followed by troughs of disillusionment, before reaching a plateau of productivity.

AI, in particular, has journeyed through cycles of exaggerated anticipation regarding its potential to replicate human intelligence, only to confront the hard realities of its limitations. Similarly, the Information Security domain has grappled with the promise and sometimes the overpromise, of safeguarding digital assets amidst an ever-evolving threat landscape.

### **The Convergence of AI and Information Security**

At the intersection of AI and Information Security, we find a fertile ground for innovation but also a terrain riddled with pitfalls. The allure of AI-driven security solutions has surged, driven by the promise of predictive analytics, threat detection, and autonomous response mechanisms. Yet, this convergence has also ushered in a phase of heightened expectations, where the delineation between genuine advancement and "snake oil" solutions becomes blurred.  Such as probabilistic solutions that will never achieve 70% assured fitness.  Or those startups that promise to review a pentest report and provide actionable, fit remediation activities with corresponding JIRA tickets or Notion tasks.

### **The Snake Oil Phenomenon**

Startups seeking funding often ride the wave of these hype cycles, presenting solutions that promise to leverage AI to revolutionize Information Security. However, as we've explored in our series, the foundational challenges—such as the curse of dimensionality, model adaptability, and the risk of ill-fitting hallucinations in output—underscore the limitations of current AI capabilities. These are not merely technical hurdles but are indicative of the gap between the hype and the achievable reality.

### **Expanding on the Hardware Costs to Solve Foundational AI Challenges**

The journey to bridge the gap between the ambitious promises of AI-enhanced Information Security solutions and the harsh realities of current AI capabilities involves more than just sophisticated algorithms and innovative data processing techniques. It demands a colossal investment in computational hardware, a prerequisite often underestimated or glossed over amidst the marketing hype.

### Understanding the Computational Demand

The foundational challenges in AI, particularly in areas like deep learning, generative models, and real-time data processing, are not just problems of code or concept. They are, fundamentally, issues of computational power. Models that can navigate the curse of dimensionality, adapt dynamically to new inputs without hallucinating, and offer real-time, contextually relevant security responses require an extraordinary amount of computational resources.

For instance, training a single state-of-the-art deep learning model to the point where it can reliably produce valuable insights in Information Security contexts—identifying threats from vast datasets, analyzing complex patterns, or generating secure code—can consume the energy equivalent of dozens of homes over several days. Each training session can require thousands of GPU hours, with the most advanced GPUs costing thousands of dollars each.

### The Scale of Hardware Investment

To put this into perspective, let's consider a hypothetical novel research problem in AI that promises to significantly advance Information Security capabilities. Solving such a problem might require training hundreds of models, each iterating over vast datasets in high-dimensional spaces. This process might need to be repeated multiple times as models are refined and hypotheses are tested.

The hardware cost alone for such an endeavor can easily escalate to tens of millions of dollars. For example, employing a fleet of NVIDIA’s H100 GPUs, each with a list price in the vicinity of $30,000, could constitute a significant portion of this investment. When considering the need for hundreds of these GPUs operating continuously for months, the financial figures become staggering. This doesn't account for the associated costs of energy consumption, cooling infrastructure, and data center space, which further inflate the investment required.

### The Reality Check

This hardware-intensive reality presents a stark contrast to the often overly optimistic projections of startups in the AI Information Security space. While their visions of leveraging AI to revolutionize the field are commendable, the practicalities of funding, building, and maintaining the necessary computational infrastructure pose formidable barriers.

Moreover, this immense cost underlines the risk of the snake oil phenomenon, where the allure of a potential AI breakthrough could lead to significant investments in solutions that fail to deliver on their promised capabilities. Investors and stakeholders must critically evaluate the feasibility of these ventures, considering not just the intellectual and software challenges but the hardware and operational costs as well.

This "snake oil" phenomenon, where solutions are oversold on their potential, represents a significant risk. It not only misleads investors and stakeholders but can also divert resources away from genuinely promising research and development efforts. Addressing complex Information Security challenges through AI requires an acknowledgment of this gap and a commitment to advancing AI within the realistic bounds of current technology.

### **Strategic Considerations for Navigating the Future**

To navigate the intersecting hype cycles of AI and Information Security effectively, a strategic approach is required. This approach should encompass:

- **Critical Evaluation**: Diligently assessing new technologies and solutions against both their hype and their tangible benefits. This involves separating genuine innovation from marketing hyperbole.
- **Balanced Investments**: Allocating resources to areas with the potential for real impact, focusing on advancements that offer practical solutions to pressing security challenges.
- **Ethical and Sustainable Development**: Prioritizing the development of AI and security technologies that adhere to ethical standards and contribute to long-term sustainability.
- **Collaborative Research**: Encouraging partnerships between academia, industry, and government to foster an environment of shared knowledge and cooperative advancement.

### **Concluding Thoughts**

As we conclude our series, it's clear that the journey through the hype cycles of AI and Information Security is ongoing. The potential for transformative change exists, but it is tempered by the need for pragmatism, ethical consideration, and strategic foresight. Our collective challenge is to harness the promise of AI-enhanced security while remaining vigilantly aware of the pitfalls that accompany the hype. By adopting a grounded and collaborative approach, we can pave the way for meaningful advancements that not only achieve technical excellence but also safeguard our digital future against emerging threats.
