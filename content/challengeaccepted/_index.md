Thriving on CTFs, bug bounties, Threat Vulnerability Incident and Emergency Mangaement for the thrill and honing my hacking skills. It's a playground for growth, tackling real-world challenges. I also relish global coding competitions, pushing limits & learning from peers. It's not just winning, it's the journey on Pain's sine wave!
